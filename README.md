# Pull Requests

I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:

1.  Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using `Reformat Code` feature of Android Studio `CMD`+`Option`+`L` on Mac and `CTRL` + `ALT` + `L` on Linux + Windows .
2.  If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
3.  Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
4.  Make sure you follow the set standard as all other projects in this repo do
5  Have fun!
